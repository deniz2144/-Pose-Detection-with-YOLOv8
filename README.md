#  Pose Detection with YOLOv8
 This Python script detects human poses in a video using the YOLOv8 neural network architecture and analyzes their positions to determine if they are sitting or standing. It utilizes OpenCV for video processing, the YOLO library for object detection, and numpy for mathematical operations. The script processes each frame of the input video, draws bounding boxes around detected persons, and annotates whether they are sitting or standing based on the angles between key body points. The output video is saved with the detected poses and annotations, providing in
